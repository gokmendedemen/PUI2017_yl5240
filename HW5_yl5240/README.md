do the homework all by myself
## 1. Assignment 1: Test the Z test:
Generate N samples from a poisson distribution and calculate the mean of each sample
all samples should have the same size n.

Prove that the z-values should follow a N(0,1) distribution (a Gaussian with mean 0 and standard deviation 1).

## 2. Assignment 2: Compare Tests for Goodness of fit
Test that in fact binomial and Poisson distribution look increasingly more similar to Gaussians as the mean of the distribution increases.


## 3. Assignment 3: investigate linear relationships between fire arm possession, homicides by fire arms, and mass shootings for different countries, considering also the country GDP
