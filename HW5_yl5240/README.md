do the homework all by myself
## 1. Assignment 1: Test the Z test:
Generate N samples from a distribution of your choice, but not a Gaussian with a chosen mean μ and standard deviation σ: N(μ, σ) and calculate the mean of each sample (all samples should have the same size n).

Assess the validity of the Z-test: If the samples are drawn from the distribution you are testing the z-values you calculate should follow a N(0,1) distribution (a Gaussian with mean 0 and standard deviation 1). Show that the distribution of z -statistics (find the formula in a statistics book or in last week’s slides) that you calculated (one for each sample) is indeed consistent with N(0,1).

## 2. Assignment 2: Compare Tests for Goodness of fit
Test that in fact binomial and Poisson distribution look increasingly more similar to Gaussians as the mean of the distribution increases.


## 3. Assignment 3: investigate linear relationships between fire arm possession, homicides by fire arms, and mass shootings for different countries, considering also the country GDP
