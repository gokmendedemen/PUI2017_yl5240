# Finish HW7 all by myself.
## Assignment 1: Citibike miniproject

The article linkage: https://www.authorea.com/users/175993/articles/211839-who-prefer-longer-citibike-riding-men-or-women


1. make an account on [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/)([instructions](https://intercom.help/authorea/host-data/integrations/jupyteripython-notebook)). 
2. Finish the Citibike analysis in HW3 in a notebook. Perform the appropriate statistical test. 
Incorporate classmate's comment  where appropriate, and discuss why the suggestions were not embraced if needed.

3. Write up a summary of the project as an Authorea article which includes:

**Abstract** - summary of idea and result

**Introduction** - a short introduction that explains what citibike is and why your question is interesting. Normally this would also include a discussion of similar work previously done (a literature review) but you do not have to worry about it now.

**Data** - a description of the data and how it is processed, including figures (with captions) that help visualize and understand the data.

**Methodology** - a description of the methodology (test) chosen, the motivation behind it, a discussion of alternative options that were not adopted.

**Conclusions** - The result and its significance, including the weaknesses and strengths of the analysis. 

The last two sessions contain figures as well as the results.



NOTES from Bianco: 
  - There is some confusion about the various chi sq tests, including understandable confusion arising from the various flowcharts that help chosing tests. In general, to test 2 proportions use the chi sq as we did for the ex-convict job reintegration exercise (most commonly called chi sq test for proportions)
  - There is some confusion about the word "parametric": a parametric test means a test that assumes something about the variables tested (often that they are Gaussian distributed). The data is not parametric, the data can follow a distribution or functional form, so a parametric test can be used, or a non-parametric test should be used (or at least acknowledge that the test makes assumptions that may not be correct)

- Be graded on the quality of the writing, as well as the correctness of the analysis; also on whether you have discussed and considered the recommandations of your "referees", the classmates that reviewed your proposal.
